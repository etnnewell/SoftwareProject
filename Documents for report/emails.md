Dear Sir/Madam

We are a group of Computer Science students studying at Goldsmiths Univesity of London, in search
for a company that will be able to give us support and feedback for our software project.

InteriAR is an innovative way of providing home owners inspiration on the go.
Our application will use tools and information to help users envision their dream home
using advanced technology known as augmented reality. users will be able to drag and drop 3d images
of furniture, and place it to create a visual image of their living. Choosing wall paint can be a 
stressful task that requires a great amount of detailing, however our app will allow users to,
choose from a wide selection of colours and testing them on their walls. This not only will,
save time, but also avoiding potential costly mistakes during renovation
